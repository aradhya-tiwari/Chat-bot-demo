Pricing
By default, users have access to the Workers Free plan. The Workers Free plan includes limited usage of Workers, Pages Functions and Workers KV. Read more about the Free plan limits.

The Workers Paid plan includes Workers, Pages Functions, Workers KV, and Durable Objects usage for a minimum charge of $5 USD per month for an account. The plan includes increased initial usage allotments, with clear charges for usage that exceeds the base plan.

All included usage is on a monthly basis.

Pages Functions billing
All Pages Functions are billed as Workers. All pricing and inclusions in this document apply to Pages Functions. Refer to Functions Pricing for more information on Pages Functions pricing.

​​Workers
Workers Standard pricing is now available
New, simplified pricing is available for Workers under a new usage model, called Workers Standard. Opt-in to Workers Standard pricing today.

Requests1	Duration	CPU time
Free	100,000 per day	No charge for duration	10 milliseconds of CPU time per invocation
Standard	10 million included per month
+$0.30 per additional million	No charge or limit for duration	30 million CPU milliseconds included per month
+$0.02 per additional million CPU milliseconds

Max of 30 seconds of CPU time per invocation
Max of 15 minutes of CPU time per Cron Trigger or Queue Consumer invocation
1 Inbound requests to your Worker. Subrequests to external services are not billed on a unit basis, but do impact the duration (wall-clock time) of your Worker.
​​Example pricing: Standard Usage Model
A Worker that serves 100 million requests per month, and uses an average of 7 milliseconds (ms) of CPU time per request, would have the following estimated costs:

Monthly Costs	Formula
Subscription	$5.00	
Requests	$27.00	(100,000,000 requests - 10,000,000 included requests) / 1,000,000 * $0.30
CPU time	$13.40	(7 ms of CPU time per request * 100,000,000 requests - 30,000,000 included CPU ms) / 1,000,000 * $0.02
Total	$45.40	
Custom limits
To prevent accidental runaway bills or denial-of-wallet attacks, configure the maximum amount of CPU time that can be used per invocation by defining limits in your Worker’s wrangler.toml file, or via the Cloudflare dashboard (Workers & Pages > Select your Worker > Settings > CPU Limits).
​​Deprecated usage models
Usage models are settings on your Workers that specify how you are billed for usage, as well as the upper limits for how many milliseconds of CPU time your Worker can use per invocation.

Starting October 31, 2023, the Bundled and Unbound usage models are deprecated. Workers and Pages Functions using Bundled and Unbound will continue to be billed at the rates below until March 1, 2024. After March 1, 2024, all Workers and Pages Functions will be automatically migrated to Workers Standard.

Requests1	Duration	CPU time
Bundled	10 million included per month
+$0.50 per additional million	No charge for duration	50 milliseconds CPU time per invocation
Unbound	1 million included per month
+$0.15 per additional million	400,000 GB-s included per month
+$12.50 per additional million GB-s2, 3	30 seconds of CPU time per invocation
15 minutes of CPU time per Cron Trigger or Queue Consumer invocation
1 Inbound requests to your Worker. Subrequests to external services are not billed on a unit basis, but do impact the duration (wall-clock time) of your Worker.

2 Cloudflare will bill for duration charges based on the higher of your wall time or CPU time, with a multiple of 8 applied to the CPU time to account for the processing power allotted to your Worker. Cloudflare will not bill for wall time duration charges beyond the execution limit given.

3 Duration billing will charge for the 128 MB of memory allocated to your Worker, regardless of actual usage. If your account has significant traffic to a single Worker, multiple instances of that Worker may run in the same isolate on the same physical machine and share the 128 MB of memory. These Workers are still billed as if they were separate instances, with each being charged as if it had its own 128 MB of memory.

​​Example pricing: Bundled Usage Model
A Worker that serves 100 million requests per month would have the following estimated costs:

Monthly Costs	Formula
Workers Paid Plan	$5	
Requests	$45	(100,000,000 requests - 10,000,000 included requests) / 1,000,000 * $0.50
Total	$50	
​​Example pricing: Unbound Usage Model
Consider a Worker that serves 100 million requests per month, with an average duration (wall-clock time) of 200 milliseconds per request. This translates to the following duration (wall-clock time) metrics:

0.2 seconds per request (200 milliseconds / 1000)
0.025 gigabyte seconds (GB-s) per request (0.2 seconds * 128 MB / 1024 MB)
2,500,000 gigabyte seconds (GB-s) per month (0.025 GB-s per request * 100,000,000 requests)
Resulting in the following estimated costs:

Monthly Costs	Formula
Workers Paid Plan	$5.00	
Requests	$14.85	(100,000,000 requests - 1,000,000 included requests) / 1,000,000 * $0.15
Duration	$26.25	(2,500,000 GB-s per month - 400,000 included GB-s) / 1,000,000 * $12.50
Total	$46.10	
​​How to switch usage model
When an account is first upgraded to the Workers Paid plan, the Standard model is used as the default usage model. If you have Workers on Bundled or Unbound, their usage model can be changed all at once to Standard or their usage model can be changed the individual Worker level.

To migrate all Workers to the Standard Usage model:

Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account.
In Account Home, select Workers & Pages.
Find Usage Model on the right-side menu > Migrate.
To change the usage model for individual Workers:

Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account.
In Account Home, select Workers & Pages.
In Overview, select your Worker > Settings > Usage Model.
To change your default account-wide usage model:

Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account.
In Account Home, select Workers & Pages.
Find Usage Model on the right-side menu > Change.
Existing Workers will not be impacted when changing the default usage model. You may change the usage model for individual Workers without affecting your account-wide default usage model.

Workers KV
Workers KV is included in both the Free and Paid Workers plans.

Free plan1	Paid plan
Read requests	100,000 / day	10 million/month, + $0.50/million
Write requests	1,000 / day	1 million/month, + $5.00/million

List requests	1,000 / day	1 million/month, + $5.00/million
Stored data	1 GB	1 GB, + $0.50/ GB-month
1 The Workers Free plan includes limited Workers KV usage. All limits reset daily at 00:00 UTC. If you exceed any one of these limits, further operations of that type will fail with an error.

KV documentation

​​Queues
Cloudflare Queues requires the Workers Paid plan to use, but does not increase your monthly subscription cost.
Cloudflare Queues charges for the total number of operations against each of your queues during a given month.

An operation is counted for each 64 KB of data that is written, read, or deleted.
Messages larger than 64 KB are charged as if they were multiple messages: for example, a 65 KB message and a 127 KB message would both incur two operation charges when written, read, or deleted.
A KB is defined as 1,000 bytes, and each message includes approximately 100 bytes of internal metadata.
Operations are per message, not per batch. A batch of 10 messages (the default batch size), if processed, would incur 10x write, 10x read, and 10x delete operations: one for each message in the batch.
There are no data transfer (egress) or throughput (bandwidth) charges.
Free Tier	Paid
Standard operations	1,000,000 operations / month	$0.40 / million operations
In most cases, it takes 3 operations to deliver a message: 1 write, 1 read, and 1 delete. Therefore, you can use the following formula to estimate your monthly bill:

((Number of Messages * 3) - 1,000,000) / 1,000,000  * $0.40
Additionally:

Each retry incurs a read operation. A batch of 10 messages that is retried would incur 10 operations for each retry.
Messages that reach the maximum retries and that are written to a Dead Letter Queue incur a write operation for each 64 KB chunk. A message that was retried 3 times (the default), fails delivery on the fourth time and is written to a Dead Letter Queue would incur five (5) read operations.
Messages that are written to a queue, but that reach the maximum persistence duration (or “expire”) before they are read, incur only a write and delete operation per 64 KB chunk.

cloudflare ​D1 database
D1 is available on both the Workers Free and Workers Paid plans.

D1 in Workers Free	D1 in Workers Paid
Rows read	5 million / day	First 25 billion / month included + $0.001 / million rows
Rows written	100,000 / day	First 50 million / month included + $1.00 / million rows
Storage (per GB stored)	5 GB (total)	First 5 GB included + $0.75 / GB-mo
​
​Definitions
Rows read measure how many rows a query reads (scans), regardless of the size of each row. For example, if you have a table with 5000 rows and run a SELECT * FROM table as a full table scan, this would count as 5,000 rows read. A query that filters on an unindexed column may return fewer rows to your Worker, but is still required to read (scan) more rows to determine which subset to return.
Rows written measure how many rows were written to D1 database. A query that INSERT 10 rows into a users table would count as 10 rows written.
Row size or the number of columns in a row does not impact how rows are counted. A row that is 1 KB and a row that is 100 KB both count as one row.
Defining indexes on your table(s) reduces the number of rows read by a query when filtering on that indexed field. For example, if the users table has an index on a timestamp column created_at, the query SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_at > ?1 would only need to read a subset of the table.
Indexes will add an additional written row when writes include the indexed column, as there are two rows written: one to the table itself, and one to the index. The performance benefit of an index and reduction in rows read will, in nearly all cases, offset this additional write.
Storage is based on gigabytes stored per month, and is based on the sum of all databases in your account. Tables and indexes both count towards storage consumed.
Free limits reset daily at 00:00 UTC. Monthly included limits reset based on your monthly subscription renewal date, which is determined by the day you first subscribed.
There are no data transfer (egress) or throughput (bandwidth) charges for data accessed from D1.

​​Durable Objects
Durable Objects are only available on the Workers Paid plan.

Paid plan
Requests1	1 million, + $0.15/million
Duration2	400,000 GB-s, + $12.50/million GB-s3,4
1 Requests include all incoming HTTP requests, WebSocket messages, and alarm invocations. There is no charge for outgoing WebSocket messages, nor for incoming WebSocket protocol pings.

2 Application level auto-response messages handled by state.setWebSocketAutoResponse() will not incur additional wall-clock time, and so they will not be charged.

3 Duration is billed in wall-clock time as long as the Object is active, but is shared across all requests active on an Object at once. Once your Object finishes responding to all requests, it will stop incurring duration charges. Calling accept() on a WebSocket in an Object will incur duration charges for the entire time the WebSocket is connected. If you prefer, use state.acceptWebSocket() instead, which will stop incurring duration charges once all event handlers finish running.

4 Duration billing charges for the 128 MB of memory your Durable Object is allocated, regardless of actual usage. If your account creates many instances of a single Durable Object class, Durable Objects may run in the same isolate on the same physical machine and share the 128 MB of memory. These Durable Objects are still billed as if they are allocated a full 128 MB of memory.

Durable Objects billing examples
For more information and examples of Durable Objects billing, refer to Durable Objects Pricing.
​​Durable Objects Transactional Storage API
The Durable Objects Transactional Storage API is only accessible from within Durable Objects.

Durable Objects do not have to use the Transactional Storage API, but if your code does call methods on state.storage, it will incur the following additional charges:

Paid plan
Read request units1,2	1 million, + $0.20/million
Write request units3	1 million, + $1.00/million
Delete requests4	1 million, + $1.00/million
Stored data5	1 GB, + $0.20/ GB-month
1 A request unit is defined as 4 KB of data read or written. A request that writes or reads more than 4 KB will consume multiple units, for example, a 9 KB write will consume 3 write request units.

2 List operations are billed by read request units, based on the amount of data examined. For example, a list request that returns a combined 80 KB of keys and values will be billed 20 read request units. A list request that does not return anything is billed for 1 read request unit.

3 Each alarm write is billed as a single write request unit.

4 Delete requests are unmetered. For example, deleting a 100 KB value will be charged one delete request.

5 Durable Objects will be billed for stored data until the data is removed. Once the data is removed, the object will be cleaned up automatically by the system.

Requests that hit the Durable Objects in-memory cache or that use the multi-key versions of get()/put()/delete() methods are billed the same as if they were a normal, individual request for each key.

​​Vectorize
Vectorize is currently only available on the Workers paid plan.

Workers Paid	Workers Free 1
Total queried vector dimensions	First 50 million queried vector dimensions / month included + $0.040 per million	30 million queried vector dimensions / month
Total stored vector dimensions	First 10 million stored vector dimensions + $0.040 per million	5 million stored vector dimensions
1 Vectorize will be available to developers on the Workers Free plan in the future.

​​Calculating vector dimensions
To calculate your potential usage, calculate the sum of your stored + queried vectors, multiply by the dimension size, and multiply by the unit price (divided by 1 million). The formula is defined as (stored vectors + queried vectors) * dimensions * ($0.040 / 1000000)

For example, inserting 10,000 vectors of 768 dimensions each, and querying those 1,000 times per day (30,000 times per month) would be calculated as (30000 * 768) = 23,040,000 queried dimensions and (10000 * 768) = 7,680,000 stored dimensions (within the included monthly allocation)
Separately, and excluding the included monthly allocation, this would be calculated as (30,000+10,000) * 768 * ($0.040 / 1,000,000) and sum to $1.23 per month.
​​Service bindings
Service bindings cost the same as any normal Worker. Each invocation is charged as if it is a request from the Internet with one important difference. You will be charged a single billable duration across all Workers triggered by a single incoming request.

For more information on how service bindings work, refer to About Service bindings.

​​Fine Print
Workers Paid plan is separate from any other Cloudflare plan (Free, Professional, Business) you may have. If you are an Enterprise customer, reach out to your account team to confirm pricing details.

Only requests that hit a Worker will count against your limits and your bill. Since Cloudflare Workers runs before the Cloudflare cache, the caching of a request still incurs costs. Refer to Limits to review definitions and behavior after a limit is hit.
